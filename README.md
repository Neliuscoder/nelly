Machine Learning
Support Vector Machines (SVM): A supervised learning algorithm that finds the best hyperplane to separate data points into different classes. Commonly used in image classification, text classification, and bioinformatics.


Random Forest: An ensemble learning algorithm that builds multiple decision trees on subsets of the data and features, and combines them to make predictions. Commonly used in fraud detection, customer churn prediction, and image recognition.

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN): A lazy learning algorithm that makes predictions based on the K closest data points to the test point. Commonly used in image recognition, recommender systems, and anomaly detection.

K-means Clustering: An unsupervised learning algorithm used for clustering similar data points together in a dataset. Commonly used in customer segmentation, market research, and anomaly detection.
